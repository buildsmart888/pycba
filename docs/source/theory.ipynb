    "\n",
    "Note that $\\theta_0$ and $\\delta_0$ are required: the rotation and translation at the $i$-node of the element. This is typically the output of the global system of equations; i.e., the nodal displacements. However, for elements with releases (types 2, 3, 4 above), we need to determine the starting rotation, $\\theta_0$. From the slope deflection equations we can find this starting rotation at the $i$-node:\n",
